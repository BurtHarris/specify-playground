# Example assistant consent file
# To allow assistants to run terminal commands in this repository,
# create a file named `.assistant-consent` (without the .example suffix)
# at the repository root containing this single line exactly:
#
# allow-terminal: true
#
# Save the file with Unix newlines (LF) and ensure it is not checked into
# a public remote unintentionally if you want local-only consent.

allow-terminal: true
