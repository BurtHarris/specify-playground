# Specify Playground Specifications

This document provides an overview of the methodologies and specifications used in the Specify Playground. It serves as a guide for understanding how to utilize the `.specify` files and the associated testing framework.

## Overview

The Specify Playground is designed to experiment with various methodologies and specifications. It allows users to define experiments, run tests, and validate behaviors in a controlled environment.

## Methodologies

### Experiment Definition

The main specification for the playground is defined in the `demo.specify` file located in the `src/playground` directory. This file outlines the experiments to be conducted and the methodologies to be tested.

### Example Tests

Example tests for the specifications are provided in the `example.spec.ts` file within the `src/playground/examples` directory. These tests utilize a testing framework to ensure that the defined methodologies behave as expected.

## Usage

To use the Specify Playground:

1. Define your experiments in the `demo.specify` file.
2. Write example tests in the `example.spec.ts` file.
3. Run the playground environment using the provided script in `scripts/run-playground.sh`.
4. Review the results of the tests to validate the methodologies.

## Contribution

Contributions to the Specify Playground are welcome. Please follow the guidelines outlined in the main `README.md` for setting up the development environment and submitting changes.
