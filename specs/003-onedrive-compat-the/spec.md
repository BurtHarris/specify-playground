# Feature Specification: OneDrive Integration and Compatibility

**Feature Branch**: `003-onedrive-compat-the`  
**Created**: September 18, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "onedrive compat - The system MUST avoid downloading onedrive files. The system Should take advantage of onedrive hashing if available"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature involves OneDrive cloud storage integration for efficient scanning
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users with OneDrive-synced video files
   ‚Üí Actions: scan cloud files without downloading, leverage existing hashes
   ‚Üí Data: OneDrive file metadata, hash information, sync status
   ‚Üí Constraints: avoid bandwidth usage, respect cloud storage limitations
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All major business requirements clarified for OneDrive integration
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Users can scan OneDrive folders without triggering downloads
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí OneDrive detection, hash extraction, download avoidance
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí OneDrive file metadata, cloud file status, hash information
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements clarified and testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users with large video collections stored in OneDrive want to scan for duplicates without consuming bandwidth or storage by downloading cloud-only files. The system should intelligently work with OneDrive's existing file metadata and hash information to perform duplicate detection while keeping files in the cloud.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** OneDrive files are present in the scan directory, **When** the scanner encounters them, **Then** the system processes them without triggering downloads
2. **Given** OneDrive provides hash information for a file, **When** the scanner processes that file, **Then** the system uses the existing hash instead of computing a new one
3. **Given** a user scans a directory containing both local and OneDrive files, **When** the scan completes, **Then** duplicate detection works across both file types without downloading cloud files
4. **Given** OneDrive files are detected as duplicates, **When** the user views results, **Then** the system clearly indicates which files are cloud-stored vs locally available
5. **Given** a user scans OneDrive files, **When** the scanner processes them, **Then** the system performs duplicate detection without downloading files

### Edge Cases
- **OneDrive offline/sync paused**: System treats affected files as unavailable and excludes them from processing with appropriate status indication
- **Partially synced files**: System processes available metadata without triggering full download, marking sync status in results
- **Limited OneDrive metadata**: System works with whatever information OneDrive provides without forcing downloads
- **Shared files from other accounts**: System processes files using available metadata while respecting permission boundaries

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect when files are stored in OneDrive and avoid triggering downloads during scanning
- **FR-002**: System MUST utilize OneDrive-provided information to optimize duplicate detection without downloading files
- **FR-003**: System MUST clearly distinguish between local files and OneDrive cloud files in scan results
- **FR-004**: System MUST perform duplicate detection between local files and OneDrive files without downloading
- **FR-005**: System MUST process OneDrive files using available metadata and comparison methods without forcing downloads
- **FR-006**: System MUST respect OneDrive sync status and not force files to download
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear indicators in output when OneDrive files are involved in duplicate groups
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain normal scanning performance when processing mixed local/OneDrive directories
- **FR-009**: System MUST perform effective duplicate detection for OneDrive files without downloading them
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle OneDrive authentication and permissions by using existing user credentials and gracefully handling access denied scenarios

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **OneDrive File Metadata**: Information about cloud-stored files that enables duplicate detection without downloading
- **Cloud File Status**: Indicator of whether a file is locally available, cloud-only, or partially synced
- **Hybrid Scan Result**: Scan results that include both local and cloud files with appropriate status indicators
