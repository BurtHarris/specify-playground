**Featur- **FR-004**: System MUST compare file sizes as the first stage of duplicate detection
- **FR-005**: System MUST compute file hashes only for files with identical sizes
- **FR-006**: System MUST group files with identical hashes as duplicates
- **FR-007**: System MUST display duplicate groups in a clear, readable format
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow exporting scan results to JSON format
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle files that cannot be read due to permission issues gracefully
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that the provided directory path exists and is accessible
- **FR-011**: System MUST ignore non-video files during scanning
- **FR-012**: System MUST skip symbolic links during scanning if their target files are included in the scan
- **FR-013**: System MUST display progress information for long-running scans
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide help/usage information when requested
- **FR-015**: System MUST support specifying custom output file path for JSON export
- **FR-016**: System MUST perform fuzzy name comparison to identify files with similar names across different extensions
- **FR-017**: System MUST report potential matches from fuzzy name comparison in a separate section for user review
- **FR-018**: System MUST distinguish between confirmed duplicates (identical hashes) and potential matches (similar names)`001-build-a-cli`  
**Created**: September 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a CLI tool that scans directories for duplicate video files (mp4, mkv, mov). It should compare file sizes first, then hash files of the same size to confirm duplicates. Output should group duplicates together and allow exporting results to JSON."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: CLI tool for video duplicate detection
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users with video collections
   ‚Üí Actions: Scan directories, identify duplicates, export results
   ‚Üí Data: Video files (mp4, mkv, mov), file metadata, duplicate groups
   ‚Üí Constraints: Two-stage comparison (size then hash)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All key aspects clarified by stakeholder input
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User scans directory and gets grouped duplicate results
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Video files, duplicate groups, scan results
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: All uncertainties resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user with a large video collection wants to identify and manage duplicate video files to reclaim storage space. They run the CLI tool on a directory containing videos, and the tool efficiently identifies true duplicates by first comparing file sizes (fast) and then computing hashes for files of identical size (accurate). The user receives a clear report of duplicate groups and can export the results for further processing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a directory with 3 identical MP4 files and 2 unique MKV files, **When** user runs the scanner, **Then** the tool identifies the 3 MP4s as duplicates and reports 2 unique files
2. **Given** a directory with files of different sizes, **When** user runs the scanner, **Then** the tool reports no duplicates without computing any hashes
3. **Given** a directory with 2 files of same size but different content, **When** user runs the scanner, **Then** the tool computes hashes and correctly reports no duplicates
4. **Given** duplicate files found, **When** user chooses JSON export, **Then** results are saved in structured JSON format with file paths and metadata
5. **Given** files with similar names but different extensions, **When** user runs the scanner, **Then** the tool identifies them as potential matches in a separate section for user review
6. **Given** a directory path that doesn't exist, **When** user runs the scanner, **Then** the tool displays a clear error message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user lacks read permissions for some files?
- How does the system handle very large video files that might cause memory issues during hashing?
- What occurs when two files have identical hashes but different filenames?
- How does the system handle files with very similar names but different extensions?
- How are empty directories or directories with no video files handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST scan directories for video files with extensions mp4, mkv, and mov
- **FR-002**: System MUST scan subdirectories recursively by default
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a command-line option to disable recursive scanning
- **FR-004**: System MUST compare file sizes as the first stage of duplicate detection
- **FR-004**: System MUST compute file hashes only for files with identical sizes
- **FR-005**: System MUST group files with identical hashes as duplicates
- **FR-006**: System MUST display duplicate groups in a clear, readable format
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow exporting scan results to JSON format
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle files that cannot be read due to permission issues gracefully
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that the provided directory path exists and is accessible
- **FR-010**: System MUST ignore non-video files during scanning
- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: follow symbolic links or treat them as separate entities?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST display progress information for long-running scans
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide help/usage information when requested
- **FR-014**: System MUST support specifying custom output file path for JSON export

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Video File**: Represents a video file with path, size, hash (computed when needed), and extension
- **Duplicate Group**: A collection of video files that are identical (same hash)
- **Potential Match Group**: A collection of video files with similar names but different extensions that may represent the same content
- **Scan Result**: Contains all duplicate groups and potential match groups found during a directory scan, with metadata like scan duration and file counts
- **Export Format**: JSON structure containing scan results with file paths, sizes, hashes, grouping information, and potential matches from fuzzy name comparison
